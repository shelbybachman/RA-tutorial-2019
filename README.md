# R, MATLAB, & Psychtoolbox Tutorial

This course (website here: https://shelbybachman.github.io/RA-tutorial-2019/) provides a whirlwind tour of R, MATLAB, and Psychtoolbox. It is designed for someone with little or no exposure to these different tools. 

The tutorial first covers the basics of R, including basic data import, cleaning, manipulation, analysis, and plotting. We covered base R functions as well as functions from the the `dplyr` and `ggplot2` packages. Next, the tutorial covers basic MATLAB syntax and data structures, and we introduce the Psychtoolbox for the development of experiments. In the final weeks of the course, we design a basic experiment (stroop task) and, after collecting data from the experiment, use R to analyze and visualize the results.

The tutorial was held over an 11-week period. Each week generally includes a set of slides - many of which contain links to resources for getting more training and practice using R and MATLAB.
